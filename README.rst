man-hours. （Mainly for Japan)

`中文版文档 <https://github.com/wavky/ManHourCalendar/blob/master/README.zh.md>`__

This is a CLI tool, just as my first python project, created to deal
with my monthly man-hour calculation.

Usage
-----

The simply way to use it like this flow:

.. code:: sh

    # Initialize your Job file first.
    # It will also update the Japanese holidays schedule at the first time.
    $ python3 mhcalendar.py -J ...

    # Check out the man-hour schedule of current month.
    $ python3 mhcalendar.py

    # Check in your man-hour of first day.
    # Ensure that you will check in everyday.
    $ python3 mhcalendar.py -c 8

    # Check out your schedule again to confirm your next day's work hours.
    $ python3 mhcalendar.py


    # Schedule your day off or on duty days anytime before it comes.
    # For example, make date of 9, 10 and 11 as dayoff, and go to work at 13th.
    $ python3 mhcalendar.py --dayoff -- 9 10 11 -13

    # Remember to Update your schedule by calling this
    $ python3 mhcalendar.py

For more information you can check it out by command:

.. code:: sh

    $ mhcalendar -h

Also you can run it by your python script, refer to this file:

`Example.py <https://github.com/wavky/ManHourCalendar/blob/master/mhcalendar/example.py>`__

This program is written in python3, you need to install the python3 and
pip3 before this installation.
